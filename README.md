# CO_NaCl_Estat
Simulated annealing Metropolis search for the global minimum 
for CO monolayer at NaCl(100)

    CO-NaCl interaction is modeled by Meredith & Stone potential

    CO-CO interaction is modeled by NN-PES by Guo's group

    IR Spectra is generated using Exciton model based on R. Disselkamp, H. Chang, and G.E. Ewing, Surf. Sci. 240 (1990) 193-210
